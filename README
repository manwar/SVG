README for SVG.pm

SVG.pm is a perl extension to generate standalone or inline SVG 
(short for "Scalable Vector Graphics") images using the W3C's
SVG XML recommendation.

Refer to the POD documentation for full documentation and an example
script, or to the following mirror:

    https://metacpan.org/module/SVG

The complete POD documentation for SVG resides in the SVG module itself -
type "perldoc SVG" on the command line.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

***THERE ARE FOUR WAYS TO INSTALL THE SVG MODULE IN PERL***

	1/ Systems with CPAN support (all Windows/Unix/Linux/BSD/Mac):
	-----------------------------------------------------

	Install the new distribution via the Perl CPAN module:
	In a shell:
	/home/somewhere% cpan install SVG"

    You can alternatively use CPANPLUS or cpanm.

	2/ (Windows) install Perl from ActiveState:
	-----------------------------------------------------

	Make sure you already have perl or get it here: http://www.activestate.com
	On the command line:
	 C:\> ppm install SVG

	3/ Use RPMs:
    ------------

	Download the source RPM of your choice.
	In a shell:
	/hom/somewhere/% rpm -ihv SVG-source-rpm-name
	You may be prompted for the root password

	4/ The hard way (requires make, dmake or nmake, tar, gunzip, and gcc):
	----------------------------------------------------------------------

	This method was tested in DOS, Windows, AS400, Linux, Unix, BSD, Mac.
	Hard-headed users can directly get the distribution from a CPAN mirror.
	First download the source.
	Then, in a shell:
	/home/somewhere% gunzip SVG-2.27.tar.gz
	/home/somewhere% tar-xvf SVG-2.27.tar
	cd SVG-2.1
	make
	make test
	make install

KNOWN BUGS & ISSUES
-------------------

Comments tags before the <svg> element are toxic. This is being worked on but I
can not promise anything.

Please submit bug reports to http://rt.cpan.org
